<h2><a href="http://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=paige01sat" target="blank">Satchel Paige</a></h2>
<p>{placeholder for picture}</p>
<p>Stats: Wins: 112, Losses: 60, ERA: 2.36, Innings Pitched: 1521, Strikeouts: 1469</p>
<p>Negro League Stats are incomplete, and that perhaps does a disservice to no one more than pitcher Satchel Paige. Some speculate that his total career wins were significantly into four digits. According to Paige’s own recollection and records, he has more than 2,500 games pitched with about 2,000 victories, around 250 shutouts, a record of 22 strikeouts in a game, 50 no-hitters, a 21-game winning streak, a 62-inning scoreless streak, a day in which he had three victories and a year in which he pitched in more than 150 games. The legend of Paige only grows when you consider that no one knows exactly when he was born, so there is speculation he was pitching at a high level into his 50s.

<h2><a href="http://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=gibso01jos" target="blank">Josh Gibson</a></h2>
<p>{placeholder for picture}</p>
<p>Stats: Batting Avg: .361, On Base Percentage: .442, Slugging Percentage: .676, OPS: 1.118, Home Runs: 194, RBI: 872</p>
<p>Catcher Josh Gibson was one of the most feared hitters by those who had to pitch against him. The great Buck O’Neil described Gibson as having the power of Babe Ruth and the hitting ability of Ted Williams. It is widely believed by those who watched him play and historians that he would have changed the way home runs are viewed if he got the chance to play in the major leagues. Satchel Paige was teammates for some time with Gibson while they both played for the Pittsburgh Crawfords, and he said that Gibson was the best hitter he has ever pitched against. While no one has been able to verify whether Gibson actually hit a home run outside of Yankee Stadium, there are accounts of him hitting a 480-foot home run when he was 18 years old. While Gibson unfortunately passed when he was 35 years old, so the major leagues never got to see his talent, he absolutely left his mark on the game.

<h2><a href="http://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=charl01osc" target="blank">Oscar Charleston</a></h2>
<p>{placeholder for picture}</p>
<p>Stats: Batting Avg: .350, On Base Percentage: .429, Slugging Percentage: .575, OPS: 1.004, Home Runs: 191, RBI: 1190</p>
<p>Center Fielder Oscar Charleston is another legendary baseball player whose talents never saw the major leagues. When talking to historians and players about who they greatest player of all time could be, Charleston’s name will always be brought up by those who are aware of his accomplishments and game. Buck O’Neil has gone on record saying that the best Major League Baseball player he ever saw was Willie Mays, but the greats baseball player he ever was Charleston. His impact extends far past the baseball field, despite his legendary defense and bat, as he aided Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager, Branch Rickey, in scouting a young player named Jackie Robinson. Charleston’s role in breaking baseball’s color barrier is a lesser known part of his legacy.
