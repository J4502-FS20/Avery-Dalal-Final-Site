<h2><a href="http://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=paige01sat" target="blank">Satchel Paige</a></h2>
<img src="paige_leroy_lg.jpg" alt="Picture of Satchel Paige">
<p>Stats: Wins: 112, Losses: 60, ERA: 2.36, Innings Pitched: 1521, Strikeouts: 1469</p>
<p>Negro League Stats are incomplete, and that perhaps does a disservice to no one more than pitcher Satchel Paige. Some speculate that his total career wins were significantly into four digits. According to Paige’s own recollection and records, he has more than 2,500 games pitched with about 2,000 victories, around 250 shutouts, a record of 22 strikeouts in a game, 50 no-hitters, a 21-game winning streak, a 62-inning scoreless streak, a day in which he had three victories and a year in which he pitched in more than 150 games. The legend of Paige only grows when you consider that no one knows exactly when he was born, so there is speculation he was pitching at a high level into his 50s. Paige exemplified the showmanship that made the Negro Leagues so popular, by guaranteing to strikeout the first six batters or ordering his outfielders to go back to the dugout.

<h2><a href="http://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=gibso01jos" target="blank">Josh Gibson</a></h2>
<img src="gibson_josh_lg.jpg" alt="Picture of Josh Gibson">
<p>Stats: Batting Avg: .361, On Base Percentage: .442, Slugging Percentage: .676, OPS: 1.118, Home Runs: 194, RBI: 872</p>
<p>Catcher Josh Gibson was one of the most feared hitters by those who had to pitch against him. The great Buck O’Neil described Gibson as having the power of Babe Ruth and the hitting ability of Ted Williams. It is widely believed by those who watched him play and historians that he would have changed the way home runs are viewed if he got the chance to play in the major leagues. Satchel Paige was teammates for some time with Gibson while they both played for the Pittsburgh Crawfords, and he said that Gibson was the best hitter he has ever pitched against. While no one has been able to verify whether Gibson actually hit a home run outside of Yankee Stadium, there are accounts of him hitting a 480-foot home run when he was 18 years old. While Gibson unfortunately passed when he was 35 years old, so the major leagues never got to see his talent, he absolutely left his mark on the game.

<h2><a href="http://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=charl01osc" target="blank">Oscar Charleston</a></h2>
<img src="charleston_oscar_lg.jpg" alt="Picture of Oscar Charleston">
<p>Stats: Batting Avg: .350, On Base Percentage: .429, Slugging Percentage: .575, OPS: 1.004, Home Runs: 191, RBI: 1190</p>
<p>Center Fielder Oscar Charleston is another legendary baseball player whose talents never saw the major leagues. When talking to historians and players about who they greatest player of all time could be, Charleston’s name will always be brought up by those who are aware of his accomplishments and game. Buck O’Neil has gone on record saying that the best Major League Baseball player he ever saw was Willie Mays, but the greats baseball player he ever was Charleston. His impact extends far past the baseball field, despite his legendary defense and bat, as he aided Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager, Branch Rickey, in scouting a young player named Jackie Robinson. Charleston’s role in breaking baseball’s color barrier is a lesser known part of his legacy.

<h2><a href="http://www.nlbpa.com/the-athletes/johnson-mamie---peanut" target="blank">Mamie "Peanut" Johnson</a></h2>
<img src="johnson_mamie_lg.jpg" alt="Picture of Mamie Johnson">
<p>Stats: Wins: 33, Losses: 8, Batting Avg: ~.285</p>
<p>Mamie Johnson is one of the three women to play in the Negro Leagues, along with Toni Stone and Connie Morgan. Johnson was the first female pitcher in the Negro Leagues. Her nickname, “Peanut,” was given to her because of her height, where she stood at five feet three inches. While she doesn’t have many stats recorded, she is believed to have won 33 games and lost 8. She pitched for the Indianapolis Clowns from 1953 to 1955. Some say that Johnson should be recognized in the same regard as Babe Ruth for her two-way play, as a pitcher and hitter, due to barrier breaking reasons. MLB.com has her career batting average was somewhere in between .280 and .285. Johnson was discovered playing baseball on a sandlot when it was suggested to her that she go pro by former Negro Leagues player, Bish Tyson. </p>

<h2><a href="https://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=bell-01coo" target="blank">Cool Papa Bell</a></h2>
<img src="bell_james_lg.jpg" alt="Picture of Cool Papa Bell">
<p>Stats: Batting Avg: .324, On Base Percentage: .393, Slugging Percentage: .445, OPS: .838, Home Runs: 58, RBI: 628</p>
<p>Cool Papa Bell played in the Negro Leagues from 1922 to 1946. By all accounts, he was the fastest player in the Negro Leagues, and maybe even the fastest baseball player ever. Bell began his career as a pitcher, whose arsenal featured curveballs, knuckleballs and screwballs, which he threw at three different release points. After an injury to his pitching arm, Bell moved into center field which suited his speed well. Bell would play very shallow in center field and was able to track down fly balls in deep center field. Legend has it that Bell stole 175 bases in a 200-game season and was also able to round the bases in 12 seconds flat. Satchel Paige even said, “One time he hit a line drive right past my ear. I turned around and saw the ball hit him sliding into second."</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=dandr01ray" target="blank">Ray Dandridge</a></h2>
<img src="dandridge_ray_lg.jpg" alt="Picture of Ray Dandridge">
<p>Stats: Batting Avg: .322, On Base Percentage: .364, Slugging Percentage: .436, OPS: .799, Home Runs: 4, RBI: 150</p>
<p>Ray Dandridge is considered the greatest third baseman to never make it into the major leagues. His 22-year career began in the Negro Leagues in which he primarily played for the Newark Eagles. His acumen at third base is highly credited to his defense, where he is considered the best defensive third baseman in the Negro Leagues. Even though he was bow-legged, that never affected his fielding. His accolades spanned throughout his career, in which he was a three time All Star in the Negro Leagues, an All-Star in his stint in Mexico, was inducted into the Mexican Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989 and was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=leona01buc" target="blank">Buck Leonard</a></h2>
<img src="leonard_buck_lg.jpg" alt="Picture of Buck Leonard">
<p>Stats: Batting Avg: .343, On Base Percentage: .447, Slugging Percentage: .579, OPS: 1.026, Home Runs: 103, RBI: 594</p>
<p>Buck Leonard played a Negro League record 17-seasons for one team, the Homestead Grays. He and Josh Gibson hit back-to-back on the Grays and lead the team to four straight Negro League World Series, winning the latter two. He and Gibson were the first two position players inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972. When Leonard was 40 years old, in 1948, he led the league with a .395 batting average and tied the home run lead with 42. While Leonard never made it to the major leagues, he is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time and one of the all-time great first baseman. </p>

<h2><a href="http://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=wells01wil" target="blank">Willie Wells</a></h2>
<img src="wells_willie_lg.jpg" alt="Picture of Willie Wells">
<p>Stats: Batting Avg: .328, On Base Percentage: .406, Slugging Percentage: .532, OPS: .938, Home Runs: 146, RBI: 920</p>
<p>Willie Wells is considered one of the all-time great shortstops, regardless of league. While he primarily is known for playing in the Negro Leagues and in Canada, he garnered the nickname “El Diablo” while playing in the Mexican league, with players saying, “Don’t hit it to shortstop because ‘El Diablo’ plays there.” Wells was the definition of a five-tool player, as he could hit for average and power, run and was an incredible defensive shortstop, who, by all accounts, had a very accurate throwing arm. Later in his career, Wells shared an infield with Ray Dandridge on the Newark Eagles, along with fellow future hall of famer, Mule Suttles, for which they were given the nickname, “million dollar infield.”</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=foste01rub" target="blank">Andrew "Rube" Foster</a></h2>
<img src="foster_andrew_lg.jpg" alt="Picture of Rube Foster">
<p>Stats: Wins: 50, Losses: 18, ERA: 2.25, Innings Pitched: 680.1, Strikeouts: 369</p>
<p>Andrew “Rube” Foster’s importance extends far past his great play and managing on the field, he is considered “The Father of Black Baseball.” Long before Jackie Robinson broke the major league’s color barrier, the Negro League’s origins can trace its way back to Foster. On top of being one of the great pitchers in the history of the Negro Leagues, Foster also became a player-manager on the Chicago Leland Giants. Some say that team won 128 of their 134 games in 1910. The desire to create a unified black league came when Foster wanted for black owners to determine their own schedules and control gate receipts. In 1920, Foster surprised everyone at a meeting when he brought a charter for the “Negro National League.” The league was an instant success and operated under the slogan, “We Are the Ship, All Else the Sea.”</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=robin01jac" target="blank">Jackie Robinson</a></h2>
<img src="robinson_jackie_lg.jpg" alt="Picture of Jackie Robinson">
<p>Stats: Batting Avg: .384, On Base Percentage: .445, Slugging Percentage: .606, OPS: 1.052, Home Runs: 3, RBI: 23</p>
<p>Before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in the major leagues, he played one season in the Negro Leagues for the Kansas City Monarchs in 1945. Robinson was an all-world athlete, playing four sports in college at UCLA: baseball, basketball, track and football. He began playing for the Monarchs when most of their infield was depleted due to players off fighting in the war. Robinson was one of the best infielders in the Negro Leagues, hitting for power and average and also being a prolific base stealer. When he was approached by Branch Rickey, the manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, to play in the major leagues, Robinson kept it under wraps for some time. Later, when Rickey put the idea out there, Robinson expressed doubts to his roommate, Gene Benson, about being able to make it on the Dodgers. Benson told Robinson if he could hit pitching in the Negro Leagues, he could hit pitching in the major leagues.</p>
